To select or deselect multiple clips individually hold Ctrl (command on macOS) while clicking the clips.

Entering Time Values
Timecode fields—such as the prominent one at the bottom of the player—do not require you to enter a full timecode value. There are some short-hand ways to enter time values. First of all, a number with no colons (e.g., 100) is a frame number. Remember, frame numbers start at 0; so 100 is the 101-th frame! Including a colon (:) makes it interpret as timecode (HH:MM:SS:FF where FF = frames) or a clock value (HH:MM:SS.MS where MS = milliseconds or any fraction of a second). The difference between the two is that the last field is delimited by a colon or decimal point (a comma in some locales). Next, not all of the fields of the time value need to be included. For example, you can enter “::1.0” for one second. However, not all of the separators need to be included - they are evaluated from right-to-left. Thus, for our example, “1:” is short for one second; however, “:1.0” or “:1.” is also one second but not “1.0” because it does not contain a colon. “:1.5” is one and a half seconds. “1::” is one minute. “1:30:” is one minute and thirty seconds. “1:::” is one hour.
