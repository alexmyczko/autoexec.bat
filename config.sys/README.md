# Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick

It is written in the Book of Linux on the desktop:

```
    Ubuntu is an ancient african word meaning,
    unfortunately I can not install Debian.
    But Debian really is what I need.

You, a new Linux admin, face a ton of Linux installations,
with many users, and no organisation. You are destined to
recover the chaos. Your hour of destiny has come. For the
sake of us all:  Go bravely and send back patches!
```

# Read the source, Luke

Obviously this doesn't help, so here's a short description about what these things are for

`ubuntu-remove-snap-firefox` remove snap from your Ubunut, and install the Firefox Mozilla PPA repository

`ubuntu-remove-phased-updates` getting rid of phased updates of Ubunut (useful if you turn off automatic error reporting, which is not publicly accessible anymore). See comments for reference.

# Ubuntu is Debian-based the same way milk is grass-based

`ubuntu-deluxe` kind of Ubuntu Pro, without the Ubuntu, makes a Debian 12 from your Ubuntu 22.04 (WIP)
