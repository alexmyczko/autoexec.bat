# Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick

It is written in the Book of Linux on the desktop:

```
    Ubuntu is an ancient african word meaning,
    unfortunately I can not install Debian.
    But Debian really is what I need.

You, a new Linux admin, face a ton of Linux installations,
with many users, and no organisation. You are destined to
recover the chaos. Your hour of destiny has come. For the
sake of us all:  Go bravely and send back patches!
```
